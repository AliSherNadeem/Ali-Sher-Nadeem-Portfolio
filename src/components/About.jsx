          For back-end work, I use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to ensure
          everything runs well. I also know how to use Git, GitHub, and JIRA to
          manage projects and work with teams. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree and
          experience in meeting project deadlines, I am eager to join as an
          Associate Developer. I want to use my skills to contribute to
          meaningful and successful projects.
